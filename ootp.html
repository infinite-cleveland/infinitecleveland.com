      <h1>Out of the Park Baseball Simulator</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Out of the Park Baseball Simulator (OOTP) is a computer game 
that lets you control and simulate baseball leagues and teams.
The game can simulate everything from multiple seasons of hundreds
of games between dozens of teams, all the way down to allowing the
user to play out a game pitch by pitch, making managerial decisions
along the way. The game is extremely flexible, with many adjustable
parameters, and the ability to either micromanage, or to allow the
computer to use its best judgement. The simulator is also programmed
with a wide variety of managerial strategies from different baseball
eras, and even the automatic decision-making is easily customized.
The program also offers a suite of tools for importing and exporting
data from a variety of formats and for a variety of uses, ranging from
raw data in CSV format, to pre-formatted HTML pages and stylesheets.</p>
<p>For Infinite Cleveland, we used OOTP in Exhibition Mode, which is a
way of simulating a single playoffs game, series, or bracket.
(Infinite Cleveland is just scratching the surface of the different
ways of dipping into the pool of infinite timelines.)</p>
<h2>Exhibition Games</h2>
<p>OOTP has several simulation modes. To simulate a single
Word Series game, we run OOTP in Exhibition Mode. We can
set up an exhibition game between any two historical teams,
but we can also pick a particular World Series matchup.
We can also set up an exhibition match that is a single game.
We set the roster to 17 players, to match the number of
players that were on the field during the real Game 3.
The remaining players are benched, to ensure realistic
rotations during the games (for example, not having the
Game 4 starters come into the game to pitch in relief).</p>

<h2>Roster Setup</h2>
<p>The roster takes a bit of work to set up correctly, but it only needs
to be done once - we'll freeze the game state once we set up the rosters
and before we start the game, and create a copy of the game for each
new simulation/timeline.</p>
<p>We obtained the roster of players used in Game 3 of the 1997 World Series
from <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CLE/CLE199710210.shtml">baseball-reference.com (link)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Rosters Tab:</strong></p>
<p>To set up the rosters for the game, we started at the Rosters tab.
Players that were in Game 3 were moved to the left side (active roster),
while players that were not in Game 3 were moved to the right side
(reserve roster).</p>
<p>From baseball-reference.com we can get the list of players and pitchers who
participated in the game, the batting order, and the positions each player was at:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of baseball-reference.com Florida Marlins lineup for 1997 World Series Game 3." src="/img/baseballreference1.png"></p>
<p>Next, we organize the left/right sides of the roster page. Here is a screenshot
of the Florida Marlins roster with Game 3 players active:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of OOTP roster for 1997 Florida Marlins in World Series Game 3." src="/img/ootp3.png"></p>
<p><strong>Lineups Tab:</strong></p>
<p>To arrange which players play at which positions, move to the Lineups tab.
Set the starting pitchers (Al Leiter for the Marlins, Charles Nagy for the Indians)
and a 1-man rotation, so that all other pitchers will be in the bullpen.
Next, set the batting lineup to be identical to the Game 3 batting lineup,
and put each player at the corresponding position. Here is a screenshot of
the batting lineup for the Florida Marlins, set up with Game 3 players:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of OOTP lineup for 1997 Florida Marlins in World Series Game 3." src="/img/ootp4.png"></p>
<p><strong>Play Ball! Tab:</strong></p>
<p>Once the lineups are set, click the Play Ball! tab, and you'll see the green buttons to
either "Play" (watch the game as it is simulated) or "Simulate" (get an instantaneous
simulation).</p>
<p>Before clicking either, click "Return to OOTP Main Screen". The game state will be automatically saved,
no lineups or rosters will be lost.</p>
<p>(If you go to Saved Games from the OOTP Main Screen, you should see the Historical Exhibition
match automatically saved under the name "HistoricalExhibition" or "HistoricalExhibition.lg".)</p>
<h2>Copying a Saved Game</h2>
<p>Now that the game has the correct teams and lineups, and has been saved prior to any
simulations being run, we can do some grunt work on the command line or in the folder
explorer to stash a copy of the unsimulated World Series Game 3, and create new copies
of that original each time we want to generate a new timeline.</p>
<p>Start by locating the directory where OOTP stores application data; it should be listed
somewhere in the game's Settings panel. On a Mac, the application's data directory is here:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ <span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/Users/&lt;username&gt;/Library/Application Support/Out of the Park Developments/OOTP Baseball 20&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>There are many files and parameters contained in this folder, but here we only cover how to
generate copies of a single frozen saved game.</p>
<p>The directory <code>saved_games</code> contains the saved games, which are contained in folders with an
<code>.lg</code> extension. By default, the exhibition match we created and automatically saved when
we jumped to the OOTP Main Screen will be called <code>HistoricalExhibition.lg</code>.</p>
<p>There is also a <code>saved_games.dat</code> file, which contains references to all of the saved games
(and is used to create the list of saved games on the OOTP main screen). The <code>saved_games.dat</code> file
must be consistent with the saved games that are present - if it contains a reference to
<code>KentuckyMinorLeagueSeason.lg</code>, then that save file must be present or OOTP will get confused.</p>
<p>However, fortunately for game hackers, this file can be deleted, and OOTP will automatically
check the contents of <code>saved_games</code> and create a new <code>saved_games.dat</code> for us. That means we can
move our clean, unsimulated <code>HistoricalExhibition.lg</code> game to a stash directory, and we can
create a brand new game/timeline as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove or rename <code>saved_games</code> if it exists</li>
<li>Create a new, empty directory named <code>saved_games</code> in the OOTP data directory</li>
<li>Copy <code>HistoricalExhibition.lg</code> (the clean, unsimulated game) into the new, empty <code>saved_games</code> directory</li>
<li>Start up OOTP Baseball Simulator; this will automatically create a <code>saved_games.dat</code> file</li>
<li>Click "Load Game" and load up your clean, unsimulated exhibition game with correct rosters and lineups.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Timeline Generation Assembly Line</h2>
<p>Once you've created your clean, unsimulated game, it takes a minute or less to perform the steps above,
load up the clean, unsimulated game, click the green "Simulate Game" button, and then click
"Return to OOTP Home Screen" (which will automatically save the outcome of the game that was
just simulated). The entire state of the simulator is stored in the save file, so once the
game is simulated and saved, you can stash that directory.</p>
<p>Once you have a saved game stashed away, you can come back to it by moving it back into <code>saved_games</code> and
re-opening the saved game in OOTP. You can perform tasks like replying the game in the 3D simulator,
generating an almanac (collection of HTML pages with information about teams, players, and games),
or exporting statistical data about the exhibition game to CSV files.</p>
