<h2>Timeline 3: 1 Out Shy of a Complete Game Shutout (W, CLE 6-0 FLA)</h2>
<p>Shutting down the Florida offense, Charles Nagy came 1 out shy of pitching a complete game
shutout, with Brian Anderson coming on in relief for the very last out. Nagy struck out 8
and walked only 2. Anderson only came on in relief to help Nagy out of a two-on, two-out,
bottom-of-the-ninth jam, and Cleveland notched a shutout victory against Florida.</p>

<h2>Timeline 8: Eight Solid Innings (W, CLE 12-2 FLA)</h2>
<p>Timeline 8 saw a solid outing by the Cleveland offense, backed up by 8 solid innings from
Charles Nagy, who struck out 6 and gave up just 2 walks and 2 runs. Given the 12 insurance
runs, Nagy's performance was just what Cleveland needed to come out on top.</p>

<h2>Timeline 18: 17 Going On 18 (W, CLE 17-5 FLA)</h2>
<p>Cleveland ripped Florida a new one in Timeline 18, going up 14-0 in the 4th inning.
Nagy limited Florida to just 1 run in 8 innings, and despite a 9th-inning pitching meltdown
by Eric Plunk, who gave up a walk, a single, a sacrifice run, and a 3-run home run,
it was Nagy's lights-out performance, not Plunk's meltdown, that grabbed the headline,
and in any case the Indians had plenty of breathing room, winning by a final score of 17-5.</p>

<h2>Timeline 46: Complete Game 2-Hitter (W, CLE 7-0 FLA)</h2>
<p>In a dominant performance, Nagy pitched a complete-game 2-hitter
in Timeline 46, holding the Marlins to just 3 total bases
and striking out 6.</p>
<p>It took 109 pitches for Nagy to put away the Marlins for good,
and Nagy was backed up by solid run support from Cleveland,
starting early with Thome's 2-run home run off Al Leiter.</p>

<h2>Timeline 53: 8 Strikeouts in 6 Innings (W, CLE 3-2 FLA)</h2>
<p>Nagy's Timeline 53 outing was modest, lasting just 6 innings, but Nagy notched
8 strikeouts, giving up just 1 run in the 2nd inning off of a walk to Bonilla
and a double by Charles Johnson.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Al Leiter pitched 8 innings of shutout ball in a tight game, getting the job done
despite notching only 3 strikeouts. </p>
<p>In a tight game, Cleveland and Florida went into the bottom of the ninth with Florida
ahead 2-1. Rob Nen came in to relieve Lieter, and in classic "Nenth Worst" fashion,
issued a walk to David Justice, gave up a single to Alomar Jr. that put Justice on third,
then surrendered the tying run on a wild pitch that was so wild Justice could have
walked home.</p>
<p>Manny hit a sacrifice fly that moved Alomar Jr. to third, and Counsell got tied up on a
routine ground ball to second by Tony Fernandez that allowed Fernandez to reach first,
and allowed Alomar Jr. to score from third, costing Florida the game.</p>

<h2>Timeline 56: 7 Going On 18 (W, CLE 7-4 FLA)</h2>
<p>The course of Timeline 56 had eerie echoes with Timeline 18 for Nagy, albeit with slightly
less run support. Cleveland was up 7-0 in the 5th, and like Timeline 18, Nagy ahd held Florida
to just 1 run in 8 innings.</p>
<p>And then, just like Timeline 18, the Indians had to endure a 9th-inning pitching meltdown by
Eric Plunk, who gave up a double and a walk before (mercifully) being pulled and replaced with
Michael Jackson, who gave up a single, a sacrifice groundout, and a walk.</p>
<p>But ultimately, like Timeline 18, it was Nagy's 8 innings of lights-out pitching - not Plunk's
and Jackson's 9th inning fiascoes - that grabbed the headlines, with Cleveland coming out on top 7-4.</p>
