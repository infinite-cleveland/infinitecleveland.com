<h2>Timeline 1: Walkoff Double vs. Hernandez (15-14)</h2>
<p>In a high-scoring slugfest that closely resembles the real Game 3, Florida and Cleveland entered
the 9th inning with Cleveland up 13-10. But in the top of the 9th, a Darren Daulton solo home run
and several base hits off of Cleveland reliver Michael Jackson put the Marlins up 14-13, with Jose
Mesa coming in for Cleveland to get the third out with the bases loaded, keeping it a one-run game
and keeping the hope of a walkoff alive.</p>
<p>In the bottom of the 9th, Jim Thome got a single, and a 2-out walk put Tony Fernandez on first base.
On a 2-2 pitch from Livan Hernandez, Williams hit a fly ball double to center field, scoring Thome
and Fernandez and leading the Indians to a walk-off 15-14 victory.</p>

<h2>Timeline 14: 12th-Inning Walkoff 2-Run Home Run vs Hernandez (10-8)</h2>
<p>In Timeline 14, the Marlins started out strong in Game 3, but every time they rallied, the Indians
answered back with a rally of their own. The Indians scored 3 runs in the bottom of the 8th to tie it
up at 8 apiece, and the game remained locked in a stalemate, going from the 9th, to the 10th, to the 11th,
and finally into the 12th inning - around 1:30 AM Cleveland time.</p>
<p>Thome hit a single off of Marlins reliver Dennis Cook to start the inning, and advanced to second on a
2-out wild pitch by Livan Hernandez. On a 1-1 count, Hernandez delivered a 100 MPH fastball that Williams
took deep, a 414 foot blast into enter field, to finally bring an end to a an exhausting and freezing
5-hour marathon of a World Series game.</p>

<h2>Timeline 26: Play At The Plate Walkoff</h2>
<p>Timeline 26 was a pitchers' duel, with fine performances by both Nagy (8K, 6.3 IP) and Leiter (6K, 7IP).
Each pitcher gave up only one run, and the game was tied 1-1 going into the bottom of the ninth.
With Rob Nen on the mound for Florida, Matt Williams reached first base on a routine fly ball to 
left field that was mishandled by Jim Eisenreich. </p>
<p>Williams advanced to second on a single by Vizquel, then Bip Roberts hit a single to left field.
Williams charged home and barely beat out Eisenreich's throw from left by sliding just under
Johnson's tag, for a dramatic walkoff play at the plate.</p>

<h2>Timeline 32: Near-Miss Not-Quite-A-Walkoff Solo Home Run vs Nen</h2>
<p>In Timeline 32, Florida's pitching staff was dominating Cleveland in a 4-hit game. The Indians held on
to a 3-2 lead going into the 9th, but gave up a run and couldn't come up with anything in the bottom
of the 9th. The game was tied 3-3 going into the 10th. Florida scored 2 runs in the top of the 10th,
and it was Cleveland's last chance.</p>
<p>With one out and the bases empty in the bottom of the 10th, Matt Williams hit a solo home run off of
Rob Nen to make it 4-5, but nobody else could muster a hit. A near-walkoff solo shot by Williams.</p>

<h2>Timeline 69: 10th-Inning Walkoff 3-Run Home Run vs Heredia</h2>
<p>It is fitting that the hero of the first timeline drawn from the infinite pool - Timeline 1 - would 
also be the hero of the last one. Timeline 69's Game 3 was tied up at 3-3 in the bottom of the 4th,
and stayed that way all the way through the 9th inning. Among the many timelines full of high-scoring
routs and sloppy, error-filled games, this timeline ended up being a clean battle between two evenly-matched
pitching rotations.</p>
<p>In the top of the 10th inning, the Marlins struck first, taking advantage of a hit by pitch and an
intentional walk. Jim Eisenreich hit a go-ahead RBI single, and the Marlins ended the inning on top
5-3.</p>
<p>In the bottom of the 10th, the Marlins gave up a walk and a hit, bringing Matt Williams to the plate
as the go-ahead run. On an 0-1 count, Heredia delivered a fastball down the middle, and Williams crushed
a line drive over the right field fence for a 3-run walk-off home run.</p>
