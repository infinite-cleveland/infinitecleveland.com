      <h1>Nenth Worst: Rob Nen's Most Shameful Performances</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/n/nenro01.shtml">Rob Nen @ baseball-reference.com</a></p>

<h2>Timeline 1: Nen Turns the Tables (L, CLE 15-14 FLA)</h2>
<p>Timeline 1 was a high-scoring back-and-forth game; in the top of the 8th the Marlins were sitting
pretty with a 10-6 lead. Their chances of winning were pegged at over 90%. But Florida had a 
nightmare inning in the bottom of the 8th, with Felix Heredia giving up a 2-run blast to Sandy Alomar Jr.
that made it 10-8. </p>
<p>Nen came in to relieve Heredia, and gave up a single, allowed a run to score on a wild pitch, then gave up
a 2-run home run to Matt Williams. But Nen wasn't done; he then walked a batter, then gave up a single
and an RBI double before he was forcibly removed from the game, which the Marlins were now losing 10-13.</p>
<p>From the time that Nen entered the game, to the time when he was removed, the probability of the Marlins
winning the game dropped from around 80% to below 5%. While the Marlins would mount a comeback in the top
of the 9th, scoring 4 runs to take a 1 run lead, the Indians would rally for 2 and a walk-off win in the
bottom of the 9th.</p>

<h2>Timeline 26: Nen Blows a Pitchers Duel (L, CLE 2-1 FLA)</h2>
<p>In Timeline 26, a pitcher's duel, Leiter lasted for 7 innings, striking out 6 and giving up
just 1 run; Nagy struck out 8 in just 6 1/3. The game was tied 1-1 going into the ninth.</p>
<p>With Rob Nen on the mound for Florida in the bottom of the ninth, Matt Williams reached first base on an error
by Jim Eisenreich (LF), and advanced to second when Nen gave up a single. Nen gave up another single to left field
to Bip Roberts, and Williams charged home and dove under the catcher's tag in a dramatic walkoff play at the plate.</p>

<h2>Timeline 53: Nen Blows Leiter's Gem (L, CLE 3-2 FLA)</h2>
<p>Nagy's Timeline 53 outing was modest, lasting just 6 innings, but Nagy notched
8 strikeouts, giving up just 1 run in the 2nd inning off of a walk to Bonilla
and a double by Charles Johnson.</p>
<p>Al Leiter pitched 8 innings of shutout ball in a tight game in Timeline 53.
Leiter got the job done despite notching only 3 strikeouts, tying up Cleveland.</p>
<p>Cleveland and Florida entered the bottom of the ninth with Florida ahead 2-1 in
a close game.  Rob Nen came in to relieve Lieter. In classic "Nenth Worst" fashion,
Nen issued a walk to David Justice, gave up a single to Alomar Jr. that put Justice on third,
then surrendered the tying run on a wild pitch that was so wild, Justice could have
<em>walked</em> home.</p>
<p>Nen gave up a sacrifice fly to Manny Ramirez that scored Justice from third and advanced
the winning run, Alomar Jr., to third. Tony Fernandez came to the plate, and hit a hard 
ground ball to second that was just too hot for Craig Consell to handle; Fernandez beat out
the throw to first, allowing Alomar Jr. to score the walk-off win from third.</p>

<h2>Timeline 68: Nen's Nightmare Meltdown (L, CLE 25-24 FLA)</h2>
<p>Timeline 68 was a high-scoring, back-and-forth affair, with the lead changing hands 4 times.
Entering the 9th, it was 19-16 in Cleveland's favor, but Florida broke things wide open
with an 8 run rally that started with back-to-back solo home runs, followed up with a 9-hit
inning.</p>
<p>The Marlins had a very comfortable 8-run lead going into the bottom of the 9th, passing the
ball to Tony Saunders. But when Saunders gave up a walk, a hit, and another walk, the Marlins
brought in Rob Nen.</p>
<p>Nen started strong, striking out Tony Fernandez for the second out and putting Florida, up
by 5 runs, 24-19, within three strikes of winning it.</p>
<p>But Nen gave up a single, scoring Justice and making it 24-20.</p>
<p>Then Nen gave up another single, scoring Alomar Jr and making it 24-21.</p>
<p>Then Nen gave up another single, scoring Ramirez and making it 24-22.</p>
<p>Then Nen gave up a double, scoring Williams and Grisom and tying it up at 24-24.</p>
<p>Then, with runners on second and third, Nen tried to staunch the bleeding by intentionally walking Justice.</p>
<p>And then, setting an absolutely shameful World Series record, Rob Nen accidentally walked Sandy Alomar Jr.,
with the bases loaded, in the bottom of the 9th, of a tie game, in the World Series.</p>
<p>It was the first-ever walk-off bases-loaded walk in World Series history.</p>
