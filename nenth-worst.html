      <h1>Nenth Worst: Rob Nen's Most Shameful Performances</h1>

<h2>Timeline 1: Nen Turns the Tables (L, CLE 15-14 FLA)</h2>
<p>Timeline 1 was a high-scoring back-and-forth game; in the top of the 8th the Marlins were sitting
pretty with a 10-6 lead. Their chances of winning were pegged at over 90%. But Florida had a 
nightmare inning in the bottom of the 8th, with Felix Heredia giving up a 2-run blast to Sandy Alomar Jr.
that made it 10-8. </p>
<p>Nen came in to relieve Heredia, and gave up a single, allowed a run to score on a wild pitch, then gave up
a 2-run home run to Matt Williams. But Nen wasn't done; he then walked a batter, then gave up a single
and an RBI double before he was forcibly removed from the game, which the Marlins were now losing 10-13.</p>
<p>From the time that Nen entered the game, to the time when he was removed, the probability of the Marlins
winning the game dropped from around 80% to below 5%. While the Marlins would mount a comeback in the top
of the 9th, scoring 4 runs to take a 1 run lead, the Indians would rally for 2 and a walk-off win in the
bottom of the 9th.</p>

<h2>Timeline 26: Nen Blows a Pitchers Duel (L, CLE 2-1 FLA)</h2>
<p>In Timeline 26, a pitcher's duel, Leiter lasted for 7 innings, striking out 6 and giving up
just 1 run; Nagy struck out 8 in just 6 1/3. The game was tied 1-1 going into the ninth.</p>
<p>With Rob Nen on the mound for Florida in the bottom of the ninth, Matt Williams reached first base on an error
by Jim Eisenreich (LF), and advanced to second when Nen gave up a single. Nen gave up another single to left field
to Bip Roberts, and Williams charged home and dove under the catcher's tag in a dramatic walkoff play at the plate.</p>

<h2>Timeline 53: 8 Strikeouts in 6 Innings (W, CLE 3-2 FLA)</h2>
<p>Nagy's Timeline 53 outing was modest, lasting just 6 innings, but Nagy notched
8 strikeouts, giving up just 1 run in the 2nd inning off of a walk to Bonilla
and a double by Charles Johnson.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Al Leiter pitched 8 innings of shutout ball in a tight game, getting the job done
despite notching only 3 strikeouts. </p>
<p>In a tight game, Cleveland and Florida went into the bottom of the ninth with Florida
ahead 2-1. Rob Nen came in to relieve Lieter, and in classic "Nenth Worst" fashion,
issued a walk to David Justice, gave up a single to Alomar Jr. that put Justice on third,
then surrendered the tying run on a wild pitch that was so wild Justice could have
walked home.</p>
<p>Manny hit a sacrifice fly that moved Alomar Jr. to third, and Counsell got tied up on a
routine ground ball to second by Tony Fernandez that allowed Fernandez to reach first,
and allowed Alomar Jr. to score from third, costing Florida the game.</p>
